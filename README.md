## Hi there 👋
Hi, I’m Shashwat
I like building things that solve real problems.
Not demos.
Not half-finished ideas.
But systems that people can actually use.

Most of my work revolves around connecting people and turning complex processes into intuitive experiences. 

🔭 I’m currently working on
1. FOMO - An event hosting and Management Platform

🌱 I’m currently learning:
1. Go Lang
2. Backend Development
