## Hi there 👋
Hi, I’m Shashwat
I like building things that solve real problems.
Not demos.
Not half-finished ideas.
But systems that people can actually use.

Most of my work revolves around connecting people, simplifying workflows, and turning complex processes into intuitive experiences. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on
- 1. FOMO - An event hosting and Management Platform
  2. Go Lang
  3. Thinking Of A Project that can go big
